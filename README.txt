Hello! This is just a quick script to read and plot .mat files.

In 'data' are two image sets, one for each mouse. The images are of the entire leg, not just the tumor. 

To run the file, first install hyperslicer using >pip install mpl_interactions["jupyter"] if you use Jupyter.

Alternatively you could just read the files with the code up to the plotting section, and plot it some other way.
I have chosen to use hyperslicer since it is a nice way to scroll through the image slices.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
